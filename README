Filterprops is a portable, multi-platform, and the reloaded version of FilterFramework. Basically, it allows you to filter a list of objects based on some object's properties. FilterFramework requires you to pass strings, in form of expressions, to build filters. Filterprops, on the other hand, allows you to create strongly typed filter expressions using fluent interface. Filterprops is written using the Portable Library Tools and thus a single dll can run on multiple platforms without recompiling.

Supported Platforms:
	.NET Framework 4 and higher
	Silverlight 4 and higher
	Windows Phone 7.5
	.NET for Metro Style apps
